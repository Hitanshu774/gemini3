Maps guide:
As of the current patches, VALORANT has **11 standard (bomb/defuse) maps** that you’ll see in Ranked/Unrated:  
**Bind, Haven, Split, Ascent, Icebox, Breeze, Fracture, Pearl, Lotus, Sunset, Abyss, Corrode**. 

(There’s also **The Range** plus 5 Team Deathmatch maps like District, Kasbah, etc., but those are separate from the main tactical map pool.) 

Below is a concise but detailed overview of **each standard map**: layout, unique mechanics, and how they tend to play on attack/defense.

***

## 1. Bind – 2 sites, teleporters, no mid

- **Location / structure:** Moroccan-themed map in Rabat, with **two sites (A and B)** and **no true mid lane**; attackers must approach via two main corridors: A Short / A Bath, and B Long / B Hookah. 
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - **Two one‑way teleporters:**  
    - A Short → B Long  
    - B Long → A Lobby  
  - Teleports are loud and drop you into predictable exit rooms.
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Attacking is about **conditioning and fast rotations**. You threaten A, then instantly TP to B or vice versa, punishing slow rotates.  
  - A executes often use showers (Bath) control + A Short smokes; B hits rely on Hookah and Long control, plus utility to clear close corners.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders can **push for early info** (A Short, B Long) and fall back through teleporter.  
  - Since there’s no mid, defenders mostly worry about **two straight funnels**, making utility (smokes, nades, Sage walls) very strong at chokes.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Controllers:** Viper, Brimstone, Omen to smoke chokes and deny post‑plant.  
  - **Sentinels:** Cypher/Killjoy to hold Hookah/Long or Bath.  
  - **Initiators:** Skye, Sova, Fade to clear close corners and showers.

## 2. Haven – 3 sites, heavy rotations

- **Location / structure:** Bhutan monastery setting with **three sites (A, B, C)**, making defenders spread thinner than on any other map. 
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - First VALORANT map with **3 spike sites**, no special doors/teleports.  
  - Central **Mid / Garage** area connects to both B and C; A has its own approach via A Long / A Short.
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Attacking teams can **fake one site and quickly pivot to another**, especially between B and C via Garage.  
  - Strong macro around **controlling Mid and Garage** to threaten splits and force defenders to guess.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Because of 3 sites, defenders need good **information and quick rotations**.  
  - Usually 1 anchor per outer site (A, C) plus one defender flexing between B/Mid/Garage.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Initiators:** Sova, Fade, Skye – info on wide sites and for retakes.  
  - **Controllers:** Omen, Astra, Clove to cover many angles and support fast rotates.  
  - **Sentinels:** Cypher/Killjoy to hard‑anchor C or A while others flex.

## 3. Split – 2 sites, verticality and tight chokes

- **Location / structure:** Tokyo high‑rise city with **two sites** and a strong emphasis on **vertical fights (Ropes, Heaven)**. 
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - **Ropes/ziplines** between Mid and A Heaven, plus many elevated “Heaven” positions on both sites.  
  - Multiple tight corridors and 90° corners (A Main, B Main, Vents, Mail, Sewer).
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Takes **heavy utility** to break chokes (smokes, flashes, mollies).  
  - Mid control is crucial for splitting into B Heaven or A Heaven and avoiding purely linear attacks from A Main/B Main.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders benefit from **strong angles and crossfires** from Heaven and Ropes.  
  - Good early utility can completely stall pushes in A Main/B Main.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Controllers:** Astra, Omen, Clove for flexible smokes on many vertical angles.  
  - **Initiators:** Breach, Skye, KAY/O to force through tight chokes.  
  - **Duelists:** Raze, Jett, Neon, who exploit vertical jumps and close-range chaos.

## 4. Ascent – 2 sites, classic mid map with doors

- **Location / structure:** Floating Venice-style city in Italy with **two sites** and a large, open **Mid courtyard** connecting them. 
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - **Mechanical doors** on A Link and B Market that can be shot to break; when closed, they strongly cut rotations. 
  - Very clear three-lane structure: **A lane, Mid, B lane**.
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Mid control is **the core win condition**: from Mid, attackers can split A (through Tree) or B (through Market).  
  - Executes often involve closing a door to isolate rotations and then playing post‑plant with control of Mid/Top Mid.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders frequently **contest Mid early** (operator on Mid, KAY/O knife, Sova dart, Sage wall).  
  - Strong setups come from playing around A Tree and B Market as rotation hubs.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Controllers:** Omen/Brim for simple smoke patterns; Astra for high‑level setups.  
  - **Initiators:** Sova, KAY/O, Fade for Mid and site info.  
  - **Sentinels:** Killjoy for B, Cypher for A – both anchor extremely well.

## 5. Icebox – 2 sites, vertical and tight with ziplines

- **Location / structure:** Arctic shipping yard with **two vertically layered sites** and heavy use of containers and ropes. 
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - **Ziplines** under B, elevated planting platforms on both sites.  
  - Many vertical fighting positions (A Nest, Rafters, B Yellow, Tube).
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Emphasis on fast, explosive takes and **post‑plant lineups** (especially on A default and B default). 
  - Controlling areas like **Kitchen / Tube (Mid)** lets attackers choke rotations and flank defenders.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders use vertical spots (Rafters, Nest, Yellow, Snowman) plus utility delays (Viper walls, Sage walls, Killjoy nades).  
  - Rotations are relatively quick, but retaking high ground is risky.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Viper** is almost mandatory in many metas for her one‑ways and plant walls. 
  - **Sage** for plant walls and mid/lane control.  
  - **Initiators:** Sova, KAY/O, Skye; **Duelists:** Jett/Raze for vertical fights.

## 6. Breeze – 2 sites, long range and open spaces

- **Location / structure:** Caribbean-style island ruins with **huge open areas**, long sightlines, and two sites. 
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - Extremely **long-range fights** (A Main, Mid Doors, B Long) and wide sites.  
  - Rope/elevated areas around Mid and A.
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Attackers must **respect Operators** and use smokes/utility to cross long sightlines.  
  - Mid control is critical for splitting A or B and avoiding predictable site hits.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders can get massive value from **AWPs and long-range rifles**; they can hold deep from A Halls, Mid Nest, or B Back.  
  - However, defending post‑plant can be tough once attackers get onto site due to many angles and flank routes.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Controllers:** Viper + another smoker (Brim/Harbor) to cover big open areas.  
  - **Initiators:** Sova, Skye, Fade for long-range recon.  
  - **Duelists:** Jett/Chamber for OP play, Raze/Neon for explosive entries.

## 7. Fracture – 2 sites, H-shaped with split attacker spawns

- **Location / structure:** Desert facility with a unique **H-shaped layout** and **attackers spawning on both sides of the map**. 
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - Attackers start above A Drop/A Dish and B Arcade areas, effectively **surrounding defenders**.  
  - A and B sites are at top and bottom of the “H”, with a central defender spawn.  
  - Multiple ziplines beneath the map for fast rotations.
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Attackers can **hit from multiple angles at once** (Arcade + Main, Dish + A Main), forcing defenders into crossfires.  
  - Exact timing and coordination are critical; solo pushes get punished.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders often play **aggressive early control** (Arcade, Dish, B Main) to avoid being boxed in spawn.  
  - Strong emphasis on utility to delay and segment multi-direction pushes.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Initiators:** Breach, Fade, KAY/O to control chokes and aid retakes.  
  - **Controllers:** Brim, Astra, Viper for deep smokes and lineups.  
  - **Sentinels:** Killjoy/Cypher to watch flanks and cover one side while team fights other.

## 8. Pearl – 2 sites, pure mid-control map

- **Location / structure:** Underwater Omega‑Earth city with **two sites** and a very “classic” **lanes + central mid** design.
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - No teleporters or doors; just **clean macro design** with many paths and angles.  
  - Long corridors (A Main, B Long) but also strong close-quarters fights in Mid and Connector.
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - **Mid is everything**: winning Mid lets attackers split A or B and pinch defenders.  
  - A often plays around A Main + Art (Mid), while B attacks use B Long + Mid control.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders need good **info and early Mid pressure** (walls, knives, darts).  
  - Anchors on A/B rely on strong crossfires with rotating teammates from Mid/Link.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Controllers:** Omen, Astra, Harbor for flexible/lane‑controlling smokes.  
  - **Initiators:** Sova, Fade, KAY/O for Mid fights and site info.  
  - **Sentinels:** Killjoy/Cypher anchoring B and A.

## 9. Lotus – 3 sites, rotating doors

- **Location / structure:** Indian ruins with lush vegetation, featuring **three sites (A, B, C)** and many **rotational shortcuts**. 
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - **Rotating stone doors** between A Main ↔ A Tree and between B ↔ C, which make **fast, noisy rotations** possible.  
  - Breakable door at A Main; multiple drop-downs and tight spaces.
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Attackers heavily abuse **sound and fast rotations** – fake A, rotate through door to C, etc.  
  - B is small but central; hitting B then instantly pivoting to A/C through doors is common.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders must track **door audio** and be ready to reposition quickly.  
  - Sentinel utility on B and choke points (A Main, C Main) is vital for early info.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Controllers:** Omen, Astra, Viper/Clove to manage many site entrances.  
  - **Sentinels:** Killjoy, Cypher, Vyse to hold crucial doors and rotate hubs.  
  - **Initiators:** Skye/Fade for clearing tight spaces and punishing rushes.

## 10. Sunset – 2 sites, LA-themed, mid-centric with breakable door

- **Location / structure:** Los Angeles-inspired city at sunset, **two sites** with a very important **Mid** and connector structure. 
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - **Breakable door** near B Market that controls access between Mid and B; destroying it changes rotation timings.  
  - Traditional three-lane design: A Main, Mid, B Main.
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - **Mid control** is key to splitting either site and punishing defenders stuck on one side.  
  - B hits often use B Main plus Mid/Market pressure; A hits come from A Main and a Mid split.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Common to play 1–1–3 or 2–1–2 setups with emphasis on **fighting for Mid early** (Sage wall, KAY/O knife, Sova dart).  
  - Defenders decide whether to defend the Market door or give it up and play retake setups.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Controllers:** Omen, Brim, Clove – simple but strong smoke patterns on Mid and sites.  
  - **Initiators:** KAY/O, Skye, Sova for mid-fights.  
  - **Sentinels:** Killjoy/Cypher to anchor B or A while others flex around Mid.

## 11. Abyss – 2 sites, vertical and “no walls” edges

- **Location / structure:** Floating monastery-like structure with **two sites** and **no railings** on much of the map; you can fall off and die. 
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - **Falling hazard:** Many walkways have open edges, so knockback or movement mistakes cause instant death.  
  - Strong verticality with multiple levels and zipline segments. 
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Attackers must **control high ground** and watch their movement; satchels, dashes, and pushes can be lethal if misused.  
  - Mid and vertical positions open strong split routes into both A and B.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders can set up **punish angles near ledges**, using pulls (Astra, Viper mollies, Raze blast packs) to throw enemies off the map.  
  - Need solid crosshair placement and utility to avoid being overwhelmed by vertical swings.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Mobility duelists:** Jett, Raze, Waylay, Neon to exploit vertical space.  
  - **Controllers:** Omen/Astra/Viper with one‑ways and vertical smokes.  
  - **Initiators:** Skye/Fade/Gekko for clearing stacked high/low positions.

***

## 12. Corrode – 2 sites, environmental hazards & decay

- **Location / structure:** Industrial/corroded facility (introduced 2025) with **two sites** and heavily segmented lanes. 
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - **Decay/acid zones** in parts of the map that temporarily lower HP when traversed (similar to Viper’s mechanic but built into the environment).  
  - Tight corridors and chokepoints, with some raised catwalks and underpasses.
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Attackers must manage **timings through hazard zones** and coordinate smokes/utility to avoid being stuck low HP while executing.  
  - Heavy emphasis on **utility combos** (stuns + mollies) to break entrenched defenders on sites.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders can **anchor behind decay zones** and punish attackers crossing them.  
  - Good at stalling rushes using controller and sentinel utility combined with natural hazards.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Controllers:** Viper (synergy with decay), Brim, Clove.  
  - **Initiators:** KAY/O, Breach, Fade for clearing tight spaces.  
  - **Sentinels:** Killjoy, Veto, Vyse for locking chokes and exploiting hazardous lanes.

## 13. Non-standard maps (for completeness)

- **The Range:** Practice map in London used for aim and ability training; includes bots, spike plant drills, and recoil tests. 
- **TDM maps (District, Kasbah, Piazza, Drift, Glitch):** Smaller, mirrored/arena-style maps focused on constant fighting, weapon spawns, and respawns – no spike, no econ.
