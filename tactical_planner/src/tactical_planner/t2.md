**Attack Phase Tactics**  
The goal is to break G2’s “patient‑aim” rhythm and deny them the utility‑preserving window they rely on. Use the following layered plan for every round on every map they target:

1. **Early‑Round Utility Bomb‑Drop** – As soon as the buy timer expires, launch a **double‑flash + smoke** combo on the *exact entry corridor* that valyn, JAWGEMO, and JonahP most often use (e.g., *Short* on Bind, *Window* on Ascent, *Garage* on Lotus). The flash forces a **blind encounter** before they can set up any utility; the smoke blocks their line‑of‑sight, destroying the 15‑second “wait‑for‑contact” window.

2. **Force a Rapid Spike Plant** – With vision denied, push a high‑mobility Duelist (Jett or Reyna) to the site **while G2’s utility is still on cooldown**. Plant the Spike **as early as possible** (within 5–7 seconds of round start). A fast plant short‑circuits their perfect post‑plant hold, depriving them of the $800 spike‑plant win bonus and the time needed to set up walls or smokes.

3. **Disrupt Post‑Plant Set‑Ups** – Immediately after planting, drop a **wall/Barrier Orb (Deadlock)** or **smoke** on the site’s post‑plant anchor points (e.g., *Heaven* on Ascent, *Garage* on Lotus). This prevents G2 from planting the Spike and then “locking down” the site with Omen/Viper/Astra walls. Their post‑plant success drops from 1.0 to a forced 0‑win scenario.

4. **Economic Overrun** – Win the first 2–3 rounds on a **forced‑eco** or **half‑buy** to push G2 into a **full‑eco** state. When they inevitably must purchase a **Classic or Spectre**, meet them with a **Vandal/Operator** or **Phantom** that out‑damages their low‑tier weapons. The resulting gun‑only duels neutralise their head‑shot‑centric style, especially for valyn whose win‑rate hinges on clean 1‑v‑1 trades.

5. **Split‑Kill & Cross‑Fire Execution** – After the first entry is blinded, rotate a second Duelist to **flank** the site from an unexpected angle (e.g., a teleporter‑backed route on Bind or a vertical climb on Icebox). Simultaneously, have a Sentinel place a **wall** to cut off the primary escape path. The combined pressure forces G2 into a **2‑v‑1 or 3‑v‑2** scenario, dramatically lowering their 54 % Duelist win rate.

6. **Utility‑Burn Continuation** – Keep **anti‑utility tools** (Killjoy Nanoswarm, Cypher Trapwire, KAY/O Zero/Point) ready to **disable** any late‑round smokes or walls G2 tries to redeploy. Each denial further erodes their already low Utility Share (0.005), leaving them purely reliant on raw aim—something you now control.

**Defense Phase Tactics**  
Defending against G2 means neutralizing their aggressive entry momentum and exploiting the same low‑utility economy they use on offense.

1. **Pre‑Entry Vision Denial** – At round start, place a **smoke or wall** on the *exact* entry lane G2 will likely push (identified from the scouting report). A wall placed **one second before the timer ends** blocks their sight and forces them to **waste utility** trying to clear it, reducing their 0.005 Utility Share even further.

2. **Early‑Round Flash‑First** – When you hear the *“buy”* call, immediately **throw a flash** into the *mid‑control* choke point (e.g., *Mid Window* on Ascent). This blinds any Duelist who would otherwise swing mid for a quick entry. Pair the flash with a **quick “pop‑up” peeks** from a Sentinel (Deadlock) to catch them in a **cross‑fire**.

3. **Anchor‑Heavy Site Holds** – Assign a Sentinel (Deadlock or Harbor) to **hold the primary bombsite** with a **Barrier Orb + Harden** combo. The wall creates a **single‑entry funnel** that G2 must force through, where your team can **concentrate fire** with Vandal/Operator shots. Because G2’s post‑plant hold relies on precise wall placement, a prematurely placed barrier **invalidates their set‑up**.

4. **Utility Counter‑Play** – Keep **KAY/O’s Zero/Point** or **Cypher’s Trapwire** on standby. If G2 attempts a post‑plant wall or smoke, **disarm or destroy** it instantly. Their reliance on Omen/Viper/Astra walls means any interruption forces them into a **raw aim duel** where your equipped high‑damage weapons have the advantage.

5. **Delayed Plant Pressure** – If G2 manages a plant, **reject the traditional “hold for 45 s” mindset**. Instead, **push aggressively with a coordinated 2‑v‑1 or 3‑v‑2** from multiple angles (mid‑flank, heaven, garage). Use **high‑damage rifles** to finish the plant‑holder before the timer expires, thereby denying G2 the post‑plant win‑bonus and forcing a **reset**.

6. **Economic Trap Rotation** – When you win a round, **sell a weapon** (or go “full‑eco” on the next) to **force G2 into a full‑buy** while you are on a cheaper loadout. Their heavy post‑plant utility usage will be wasted on a round they cannot afford to plant, giving you a *money advantage* that compounds over the match.

**Key Player Tactics – Counter‑Valyn (Primary Fragger)**  
Valyn accounts for 68 entry attempts per round, a 50 % headshot rate, and a 1.2 Site KD. Neutralising him is the linchpin of the whole strategy.

| Valyn Strength | Exploit | Concrete Counter‑Measure |
|---------------|---------|---------------------------|
| **68 entry attempts / round** – constant pressure | Over‑extension on entry | **Pre‑flash** his most‑used lane *as soon as the round starts*. Follow with a **wall (Deadlock)** placed directly in that lane, cutting off the path and forcing him to **re‑position** under blind conditions. |
| **50 % headshot ratio** – reliant on clean headshots | Distance/aim environment that favours body‑shots | **Crouch‑peek** and **hip‑fire** with a **Phantom/Spectre** to force body‑shot‑only engagements. If a trade occurs, use a **Vandal** for a potential one‑shot kill; headshots become far less valuable. |
| **Site KD = 1.2** – strong when he can plant/hold | Ability to plant and win post‑plant rounds | **Plant the Spike immediately after his entry**, then **smoke the post‑plant anchor** (Heaven, Garage, etc.). This denies him the chance to set up a wall/hold and forces a **raw‑aim scramble** where his 54 % Duelist win% collapses. |
| **54 % Duelist win %** – wins most 1‑v‑1 duels | Single‑target focus | **Force 2‑v‑1 or 3‑v‑2 engagements**: have a second Duelist (e.g., Jett) **flank** while valyn pushes; simultaneously, a Sentinel drops a **wall** to cut off his retreat. This splits the damage and makes his headshot advantage irrelevant. |
| **Low utility usage** – does not bring utility to entry | When utility is burned, he is exposed | **Burn utility early** (flash + smoke) *before* he can use any of his own. Once his utility is gone, he has **no tool to recover vision**, leaving him vulnerable to a *pure gunfight* where your higher‑damage weapons dominate. |
| **Predictable entry spots** | Repetitive pushes on known angles | **Study demo footage** to map exact entry positions (e.g., *Short* on Bind). **Pre‑place smokes** on those exact pixels each round. When valyn steps onto a pixel you’ve smoked, he is instantly blinded and forced to **guess** or **retreat**. |
| **Aggressive over‑extension** | Leaves him isolated if flanked | **Set traps** (e.g., *Killjoy Nanoswarm*, *Cypher Trapwire*) directly on his entry path. When he runs through, the trap **damages or reveals** him, making him an easy target for a follow‑up shot from a teammate with a Vandal. |

**Execution Checklist for Targeting Valyn**  

1. **Round‑Start** – Throw flash + smoke on *his* primary entry lane (identified from scouting).  
2. **Within 3 seconds** – Drop a **Barrier/Wall** at the entry choke to block retreat.  
3. **Plant** – As soon as he steps into the site, **plant the Spike** (quick plant).  
4. **Post‑Plant** – **Smoke the post‑plant hold zone** (Heaven/Garage) *immediately*; prevent him from setting up a wall.  
5. **Engage** – Trade with a **Vandal** or **Operator**; aim for body shots to nullify his headshot edge.  
6. **Follow‑Up** – If he survives, **flank** with a second Duelist while a **Sentinel** holds the choke with a wall.  

By consistently applying these steps, Valyn’s entry volume is **neutralised**, his headshot advantage is **rendered moot**, and the entire G2 offensive engine collapses, leaving the opposition with a **significant handicap** for the remainder of the match.
