**VALORANT – FULL VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS OF G2 (SCOUT REPORT “G2”)**  

Prepared in the style of a senior tactical planner for a competitive Valorant roster. Every point below is derived from the supplied scouting data, the canonical game‑knowledge base (the “Exhaustive In‑Depth Examination” provided in the prompt), and the typical meta‑patterns observed in professional play (2025‑2026). The purpose is to expose every exploitable weakness in G2’s **team strategy, map setups, default site arrangements, agent compositions, player tendencies, and especially their primary fragger**. Use this as a checklist for pre‑match preparation, in‑match adjustments, and post‑match debriefs.

---

## 1. TEAM‑WIDE STRATEGIC VULNERABILITIES  

### 1.1. Patient Information‑Gathering & Delayed Engagement  
- **Core Pattern:** G2 deliberately **wait ~15 seconds** before establishing first contact and **preserves utility** (Utility Share = 0.005) to force a raw‑aim duel.  
- **Exploitable Gap:** They are **uncomfortable when forced to spend utility early** (e.g., flashbangs, smokes, or vision utilities).  
- **How to Punish:**  
  1. **Early‑Round Utility Bombard** – Open with **double‑flash + smoke** combination the moment the round begins. The sudden utility spike forces G2 to either **waste their preserved utility** or **re‑engage under disadvantage**.  
  2. **Aggressive “Fast‑Push”** – Use **high‑mobility Duelists** (e.g., Jett, Reyna) to **close the 15‑second window** before they can set up their patient hold. The goal is to **enter a site while they still have no utility and no map control**.  

### 1.2. Post‑Plant Domination & Execution  
- **Pattern:** G2’s post‑plant success rate is **1.0 (perfect)**, suggesting they excel at controlling planted spikes and executing coordinated post‑plant holds.  
- **Exploitable Gap:** Their perfect post‑plant numbers are built on **tight cross‑fire setups, precise utility usage for site lockdown, and disciplined retake prevention**. However, this also means they **rely heavily on specific post‑plant positions** (e.g., “Heaven”, “Garage”, “Long”).  
- **How to Punish:**  
  1. **Rapid Spike Plant & Immediate Defuse** – Plant the spike **as early as possible** (e.g., use a **quick plant from a concealed angle**). Then **apply an aggressive defuse** with a teammate holding a **high‑damage weapon (Vandal/Operator)** while the enemy is still committing to their post‑plant hold.  
  2. **Utility Denial for Post‑Plant** – Deploy **anti‑utility tools** (e.g., *Killjoy’s Nanoswarm*, *Cypher’s Trapwire*, *KAY/O’s Zero/Point*) **right after the plant** to **remove the utility that gives G2 their perfect post‑plant control**. This forces them into a **raw‑aim scramble** where their low Utility Share makes them vulnerable.  

### 1.3. Aim‑Centric, Low‑Utility Engagement  
- **Pattern:** Utility Share = 0.005 → G2 **eschews coordinated utility combos** in favour of “raw aim duels”.  
- **Exploitable Gap:** Their **reliance on pure shooting skill** makes them **susceptible to vision denial and crowd‑control**. If you can **obscure sight‑lines before any trade**, you force them to **shoot blind** or waste ammunition.  
- **How to Punish:**  
  1. **Pre‑Entry Blind‑Utility** – Before committing to an entry, **lay a smoke/flash** that covers the expected entry corridor. This **cancels their aim‑centric advantage** and forces them into **randomised peeking**.  
  2. **Force‑Trading with High‑Damage Weapons** – When a trade is inevitable, **engage with a Vandal/Operator** (one‑shot headshot) **instead of a low‑damage SMG**. Their low utility usage means they will often **push into these duels with only a Classic/Phantom**; a single well‑placed shot can swing the round.

## 2. KEY PLAYER TENDENCIES – VULNERABILITIES BY INDIVIDUAL  

> **Primary Fragger:** **valyn** (Entry Duelist) – 68 Entry Attempts / round, **HS = 50 %**, **Site KD = 1.2**.  
> **Secondary High‑Entry Players:** **JAWGEMO**, **JonahP**, **Leaf** (lower entry volume but still contributes).  

### 2.1. valyn – High‑Entry Duelist with Headshot Precision  
| Strength (as reported) | Weakness (exploitable) | Tactical Exploitation |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 68 entry attempts / round (very high) | **Over‑extension on entry** – each entry is a **high‑risk, high‑reward** play; if caught **mid‑push**, valyn becomes an **easy target for cross‑fire**. | • **Set up early “pre‑peek” flashes** that **blind** valyn the moment he/she steps onto a site. <br>• **Place a wall/Barrier Orb** (Deadlock) **directly in the entry lane** to **cut off the path** and force a **re‑position** where they cannot follow up with the same entry rhythm. <br>• **Focus fire** with a high‑damage weapon (Vandal) **as soon as valyn appears on a peek**; a single headshot often ends the duel before he can trade. |
| HS = 50 % (headshot‑heavy) | **Headshot reliance** → if you **force them into close‑range fights where headshots are harder** (e.g., “crouch‑peek” or “hip‑fire” situations), their **damage output drops dramatically**. | • Use **crouch‑peek** or **jump‑peek** to **reduce headshot probability**. <br>• Equip **low‑damage but high‑rate weapons** (Phantom, Spectre) to **spray and force a “body‑shot only”** scenario; this reduces the value of valyn’s headshot accuracy. |
| Site KD = 1.2 (strong) | **Site KD based on aggressive placement**; if the site is **controlled by enemy utility** (e.g., smokes that block key angles), that KD advantage evaporates. | • **Block key sight‑lines** (A‑site “Heaven”, “Short”, “Garage”) with **precise smokes** right before valyn tries to enter. <br>• **Deploy “anti‑entry” traps** (e.g., *Killjoy Nanoswarm*, *Cypher Trapwire*) **in the exact entry path** to **punish each aggressive push**. |
| 54 Duelist Win % (high) | **High win% relies on being the first to make contact**; if **multiple enemies engage simultaneously**, they can be **split‑killed** before they can finish the duel. | • **Co‑ordinate 2‑v‑1 engagements**: have a **second Duelist** coordinate a **simultaneous flank** while the primary entry is being smoked. This **dilutes valyn’s 1‑v‑1 superiority** and creates a **split‑damage scenario**. |

### 2.2. JAWGEMO – High‑Volume Entry Duelist  
- **Strength:** 71 Entry Attempts / round, **Site KD = 1.2**, strong Duelist win‑rate (52 %).  
- **Weakness:** **Heavy reliance on volume** → if **even one entry is denied**, the **overall entry pressure drops dramatically** because he is often the *sole* entry point.  
- **Exploit:** **Force a “single‑entry choke”** using **walls and smokes** that **narrow the funnel** to a **single angle**; then **hold that angle with a coordinated cross‑fire**. When JAWGEMO pushes, he will be **caught in a kill‑zone** with limited escape routes.  

### 2.3. JonahP – Aggressive Flex Entry Fragger  
- **Strength:** 71 Entry Attempts / round despite Flex role.  
- **Weakness:** **Flex role is designed for adaptability**, but JonahP’s **high entry volume** makes him **predictable** – he will **always look for the same early‑round entry spots**.  
- **Exploit:** **Pre‑position utility** (flash or smoke) on his **most‑used entry point** (e.g., “Window” on Ascent, “Short” on Bind). When he appears, **blind/deny** that spot, forcing him into **non‑entry positions** where his duel‑win rate drops (evidence shows **Site KD = 1.0**, indicating he is less lethal when not entering).  

### 2.4. leaf – Versatile Support Flex (lower entry volume)  
- **Strength:** Versatile contributions across rounds; **low entry attempts (38)**.  
- **Weakness:** **Lacks aggressive entry pressure**, meaning he is **often a secondary player** that can be **easily replaced** if the primary entry is shut down.  
- **Exploit:** **Target him only after the primary entry threat (valyn/JAwGEMO) is neutralized** – use **smokes and walls** to **box him into a non‑essential site**; then **apply constant pressure** (e.g., constant *Recon Bolt* or *Flashpoint*) to **force him to waste utility** on defensive positions.

## 3. AGENT COMPOSITIONS & DEFAULT SITE SETUPS – VULNERABLE POINTS  

G2’s standard compositions (derived from the scout report) are:

| Map | Composition (agents) | Typical Role Distribution | Vulnerability Highlights |
|-----|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Lotus** | **Breach (Initiator), Omen (Controller), Tejo (Unknown), Viper (Controller), Yoru (Duelist)** | Initiator + 2 Controllers + 2 Duelists | - **Heavy reliance on Omen’s smokes** for post‑plant holds. <br>- **Yoru’s portal** is often used for late‑round flanks but is **predictable** once the site is planted. <br>- **Viper’s long‑range anti‑plant holds** can be **punished** by early **spike plants** that cut the hold short. |
| **Pearl** | **Jett, Kay/o, Omen, Tejo, Vyse (Sentinel)** | 2 Duelists (Jett + unknown) + 2 Controllers + 1 Sentinel | - **Kay/o’s “FRAG!” grenades** are **high‑risk**; if you **disable his disarm** (e.g., with *KAY/O’s Zero/Point*), you **remove a major utility tool**. <br>- **Vyse’s wall** gives **static site control**, but **smokes that block his wall placement** create blind spots. |
| **Ascent** (first listed) | **Astra (Controller), Fade (Initiator), Raze (Duelist), Vyse (Sentinel), Yoru (Duelist)** | 2 Controllers (Astra), 2 Duelists (Raze/Yoru), 1 Initiator (Fade), 1 Sentinel (Vyse) | - **Astra’s Nebula + Rising Star** are **key for mid‑control**; they are **vulnerable to early utility denial** (e.g., *Breach Flashpoint* can disrupt Astra’s star anchors). <br>- **Yoru’s portal** is a **predictable flank**; once the enemy knows the portal location (common on Ascent), they can **pre‑aim** it. |
| **Ascent** (second listed) | **Cypher (Sentinel), Jett, Kay/o, Omen, Sova** | 2 Sentinels (Cypher/Sova), 2 Unknown entries, 1 Controller | - **Cypher’s trapwires** can be **disarmed** with *KAY/O’s Zero/Point*, removing a core defensive tool. <br>- **Sova’s Recon Bolt** can be **counter‑smoked** to deny vision; Sova’s **Hunter’s Fury** can be **counter‑flanked** by quick site rotations. |
| **Haven** | **Cypher, Iso, Omen, Sova, Yoru** | 2 Controllers (Omen), 2 Duelists (Iso/Yoru), 2 Sentinels (Cypher/Sova) | - **Iso’s unknown role** is often a **flex entry**; this mirrors G2’s general heavy‑entry style and is exploitable with the same entry‑denial tactics. |

### 3.1. Common Setup Themes Across All Maps  

1. **Heavy Control‑Heavy + Duelist Mix** – G2’s compositions always contain **at least two Controllers** and **two Duelists**. This creates a **“control + aggression”** hybrid but also **makes them reliant on the coordination of utility** (e.g., Omen smoke + Viper wall + Astra Nebula).  
2. **Low Early Utility Share** – The scout report explicitly states a **Utility Share of 0.005**, meaning G2 **rarely throws utility in the first 2–3 seconds** of a round.  
3. **Post‑Plant Focus** – Their “perfect post‑plant success” (1.0) demonstrates they **rehearse post‑plant holds** extensively. They **pre‑place utility** (smokes, walls) *before* planting, **and rely on disciplined cross‑fire**.  

### 3.2. Direct Exploitable Weaknesses in These Setups  

| Setup Element | Exploitable Weakness | Recommended Counter |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Omen / Viper / Astra post‑plant wall & smoke network** | **Heavy reliance on a few specific wall placements**. If you **spoof or delay** those placements with **early utility**, the network collapses, leaving G2 with **no post‑plant hold**. | • **Deploy a flash or smoke one second earlier** than they would, *blocking* the intended wall placement. <br>• Use **fast‑picking weapons** to **force a quick plant** before they can set up the hold. |
| **Yoru portal flanks** | **Portal location is static and known** after the first few uses. Once the enemy knows the portal, they can **pre‑aim** it. | • **Smoke the portal exit** immediately after planting; **use a wall** (Deadlock) to **block the portal itself**. <br>• **Force Yoru into a 1‑v‑1 duel** where his low utility usage cannot save him. |
| **Breach Flashpoint / Aftershock** on Lotus/Haven | **Long cooldown**; if you **force a trade before the flash is ready**, Breach loses his primary entry tool. | • **Speed‑plant** with a **quick plant** (e.g., from behind a box) to **bypass the need for Breach's flash**. <br>• **Smoke Breach’s typical flash site** with a **pre‑placed smoke**. |
| **Kay/o “FRAG!” grenades** | **Highly situational**; if **disarmed** (e.g., by *Zero/Point* or by simply **not entering the grenade’s radius**, Kay/o loses influence. | • **Pre‑empt Kay/o with a flash** right after he throws his grenade, **blinding** him and forcing a retreat. <br>• Use **an anti‑disarm ability** (e.g., *KAY/O’s Zero/Point*) to **nullify his grenade**. |
| **Viper wall / poison zones** | **Wall placement windows are narrow**; if you **use a fast shot** to **break the wall** (e.g., with a **Molotov** or **shotgun**), Viper’s area denial evaporates. | • **Shoot through the wall** with a **buckshot shotgun** or **high‑damage bullet** (Vandal) **as soon as the wall appears**, forcing Viper to **re‑wall** (costing time). |

## 4. MAP‑SPECIFIC DEFAULT SETUPS – EXPLOITABLE ANCHORS  

Even though the scout report does not list explicit **default site setups** for each map, we can infer them from the standard agent compositions and the typical **anchor points** of each map. Below are the key anchor points for the maps G2 runs most often, together with a direct vulnerability and counter‑measure.

| Map | Main Anchor Points (Default Setup) | Vulnerability | Counter‑Measure |
|-----|------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Bind** | *Short* (teleporter entry), *Long* (mid‑to‑Long), *Heaven* (mid‑high), *B‑site “Garage”* | Heavy reliance on **teleporter speed** for rapid site switches; **Short** is a **choke** that they **frequent with entry duels**. | • **Place an early smoke** on **Short** to block the teleporter exit. <br>• **Set up a wall** on **Long** to deny vision from “Heaven”. |
| **Haven** | *A‑site “Hookah”*, *B‑site “Mid”*, *C‑site “Garage”* | **Three‑site defense** means G2 must **rotate slowly**; any **early site loss** forces them into a **defensive scramble**. | • **Fast‑plant A‑site** with a **quick entry from Hookah** while they are still rotating to B or C. <br>• Use **flash** on **Mid** to **delay rotation** and force them to **hold A‑site**. |
| **Ascent** | *Mid‑control “Mid Window”*, *Heaven/“Heaven”*, *Garage*, *“Short”* | **Mid‑window is a choke for both plant and retake**; G2’s **post‑plant holds** are built around **Heaven**. | • **Smoke “Heaven”** immediately after plant; **hold “Mid Window”** with a **high‑ground angle** to **pressure them from behind**. |
| **Icebox** | *Garage*, *Mid*, *“High Site”*, *“Low Site”* | **Long sight‑lines** reward **snipers**; G2’s **low‑utility style** means they **rarely have smokes to block sniper sight‑lines**. | • **Deploy a smoke** or **wall** (Deadlock) across **Garage** to **block sniper sight‑lines**. <br>• Use **high‑damage rifles** to **pick off exposed G2 players** before they can take cover. |
| **Lotus** | *A‑site “B Site/Short”*, *B‑site “Mid”*, *“Heaven”*, *“Garage”* | **B‑site is often a “post‑plant lock” zone**; G2’s **post‑plant success** is based on **holding the planted spike in B**. | • **Plant early** at **B‑site** then **immediately throw a smoke** into **“Garage”** to deny their post‑plant hold. <br>• **Use an aggressive flank** from “Heaven” to **cut off their escape routes**. |
| **Pearl** | *Mid‑window “Mid”*, *“Short”*, *“Garage”* | **Short is a high‑traffic entry point** for G2’s Duelists; they often **push Short with Yoru or Jett**. | • **Pre‑smoke Short** before they can enter; **hold a wall** across “Mid” to **prevent fast rotations**. |
| **Fracture** | *“Garage”*, *“Short”*, *“Mid”*, *“Heaven”* | **Vertical play is heavily emphasized**; G2’s **Yoru portal** often lands on **“Garage”**. | • **Block portal landing zones** with **walls or smokes**. <br>• **Hold high‑ground angles** in “Heaven” to **pick off portal users**. |

---

## 5. ECONOMIC & ROUND‑MANAGEMENT VULNERABILITIES  

1. **Early‑Round Utility Conservation** – G2 *preserves* utility for **mid‑round / post‑plant**; therefore a **“budget‑burn”** approach (throw **all utility in the first 3 seconds**) forces them to **play without utility** and rely solely on **raw aim**.  
2. **Low Early‑Round Purchases** – Their **Utility Share is 0.005**; this means **most rounds they will be buying only a weapon**. If you **force a forced‑eco** (e.g., by winning the first two rounds), they will be **forced to use a Classic or Spectre** for the entire round. This **exposes them to pure gunfights** where you can **out‑damage** them with a **Vandal/Operator**.  
3. **Post‑Plant Economy** – Their **post‑plant success** often leads to **extended round length** (they hold the site for the full 45‑second spike timer). If you **force a quick “spike steal”** (e.g., by **planting early and defusing within 20 seconds**), you **deny them the economic bonus** for a successful plant (which includes a **$800 spike‑plant win bonus**).  

---

## 6. THE MAIN FRAGGER – VALYN – EXPLOITABLE WEAKNESS CHECK‑LIST  

| Item | Description | Direct Counter‑Action |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| **High Entry Volume (68 per round)** | Constantly looking for the first contact. | **Early flash/smoke** on his **most‑used entry lane** (e.g., *Short* on Bind, *Window* on Ascent). |
| **50 % Headshot Ratio** | Reliant on landing headshots. | **Crouch‑peek / hip‑fire** to **reduce headshot chance**; **use high‑damage weapons** to **one‑shot** if a trade occurs. |
| **Site KD = 1.2** | Strong when he can plant or hold a site after entry. | **Pre‑plant** the spike **as soon as he enters**; **deny the plant** with **smoke** or **quick defuse**. |
| **Duelist Win % = 54** | wins most 1‑v‑1 duels. | **Force 2‑v‑1** or **simultaneous engagements** using **flanking teammates**. |
| **Aggressive playstyle** | Prone to over‑extend. | **Set traps** (walls, trap‑wires, Nanoswarm) **directly in his path**; **punish over‑extension with instant kill**. |
| **Low Utility Share** | Does not rely on utility for entry. | **Bombard him with utility** the moment he steps onto a site – **he will have no utility to counter**. |
| **Positional predictability** | Entry points are repeated across rounds. | **Study his demo** to **identify patterns**; **pre‑place utility** on those exact spots. |
| **Headshot dependence** | If you **force body‑shot only** fights, his damage plummets. | **Use weapons that spray** (Phantom, Spectre) to **force body‑shot combat**; **avoid standing still** to **make headshots harder**. |

---

## 7. COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR AN UPCOMING MATCH AGAINST G2  

1. **Pre‑Match Preparation**  
   - **Demo Review:** Extract *all* entry points used by **valyn** and **JAWGEMO** on each map. Note exact pixel‑perfect positions for **early‑round smokes**.  
   - **Utility Script Design:** Build a **set of bind‑friendly utility throws** that place smokes on **Short (Bind)**, **Heaven (Ascent)**, **Garage (Lotus)**, **Mid‑Window (Pearl)**, etc., *exactly* at the moment the round starts.  
   - **Economy Simulation:** Model G2’s expected **buy‑round pattern** (full‑buy after 2‑win streak, half‑buy after a loss). Plan **force‑buy timings** to **exploit their low‑utility economy**.  

2. **In‑Match Execution – Round‑by‑Round**  
   - **Round 1–3:** **Open with double flash + smoke** on the predicted entry lane of **valyn**. If they survive, **rotate to a second entry** with a **different angle**.  
   - **Round 4–6:** **Force a fast plant** with a **quick entry from a concealed angle** (e.g., from behind a box) and **immediately start a defuse** while G2 is still committing to post‑plant holds.  
   - **Round 7–12:** **Deploy walls** (Deadlock/Barrier) **directly in the path of Yoru’s portal** or **Breach’s flash**. This **blocks their signature utility** and **forces a raw‑aim duel**.  
   - **Mid‑Round (post‑plant):** **Smoke the “Heaven” or “Garage” post‑plant zone** immediately after the spike is planted, **denying their perfect post‑plant hold**. Follow up with **a high‑damage weapon** to **pick off any lingering G2 players**.  

3. **Post‑Match Debrief**  
   - **Stat Review:** Examine **Entry Attempts**, **Utility Share**, **Post‑Plant Success**. Confirm whether G2’s utility usage increased after the first 5 rounds (sign of adaptation).  
   - **Identify New Patterns:** Track if G2 starts **using more early utility** (e.g., flashes on entry). Adjust **counter‑smokes** accordingly.  
   - **Individual Feedback:** Provide **targeted feedback** to your own players about **targeting valyn’s over‑extension** and **punishing high‑entry volume**.

## 8. FINAL SUMMARY – KEY VULNERABILITIES TO TARGET  

| Category | Core Vulnerability | Exploit Mechanism | Expected Result |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Strategic** | **Late first contact & low early utility** | **Bombard with early utility** (flash+smoke) | Forces G2 to **play without their preferred aim‑centric advantage**. |
| **Post‑Plant** | **Perfect post‑plant success built on specific wall/smoke placements** | **Early plant + immediate denial smoke/ wall** | **Breaks their post‑plant hold**, forces **raw‑aim scramble**. |
| **Utility Economy** | **Utility Share = 0.005 (one of the lowest)** | **Burn utility early**, **force a full‑eco** | **Deprives them of any post‑plant control tools**; leaves them **vulnerable to pure gunfights**. |
| **Primary Fragger (valyn)** | **High entry volume, headshot‑centric, aggressive** | **Pre‑smoke entry lanes**, **force 2‑v‑1 trades**, **use body‑shot weapons** | **Reduces his 54 % duel win rate**, **creates split‑kills**, **eliminates high‑value target early**. |
| **Entry Duo (JAWGEMO / JonahP)** | **Predictable high‑volume entry spots** | **Wall / trap placements on those exact spots** | **Denies entry**, **drops their site‑kill ratio**. |
| **Agent Composition** | **Reliance on 2 controllers + 2 duelists** → **fewer Sentinels** → **less anchored defense** | **Use walls (Deadlock)**, **disarm utility (KAY/O Zero/Point)** | **Creates gaps** in their control network; **makes site retakes easier**. |
| **Map Anchors** | **Heavy reliance on “Short”, “Heaven”, “Garage”** | **Pre‑place smoke/walls on those points** | **Denies their preferred angles**, **forces them into unfavorable repositioning**. |
| **Economic** | **Low early‑round purchases** (often Classic/Spectre) | **Force early‑round wins** → **make them eco** → **out‑gun with Vandal/Operator** | **Turns every round into a “gun‑only” duel** where G2’s low‑damage weapons are outclassed. |

---

### TL;DR – How to **Punish G2**  

1. **Blind them before they can see** – open each round with **flash + smoke** on their **known entry lanes** (especially valyn’s).  
2. **Deny their post‑plant anchors** – **plant fast**, **smoke the post‑plant hold spot**, **block their wall placements**.  
3. **Exploit their ultra‑low utility** – **force a utility‑starved state** by **burning their few utility pieces early**.  
4. **Focus fire on valyn** – **pre‑smoke his entry**, **flank him**, **trade with a Vandal/Operator** to **turn his headshot advantage into a liability**.  
5. **Control the map’s choke points** – **wall off “Short”, “Heaven”, “Garage”** as soon as they appear; **use vertical play** to **counter‑Yoru portals**.  
6. **Economically out‑maneuver** – **win early rounds**, **force an eco**, **buy a Vandal/Operator** and **pick them off** when they are forced to fight with a Classic.  

By systematically **targeting each of the vulnerabilities listed above**, you will **neutralize G2’s patient, low‑utility, high‑entry style**, **break their perfect post‑plant execution**, and **force them into unfavorable gunfights** where your team’s superior utility, positioning, and aim can dominate.
