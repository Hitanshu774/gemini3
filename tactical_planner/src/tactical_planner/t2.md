As a Senior Tactical Planner and ex-pro, I’ve seen this profile a dozen times: a team that thinks they can out-aim the server and win on pure mechanical friction. G2 is a high-functioning machine, but every machine has a mechanical failure point. Theirs is an over-reliance on a single engine—**JAWGEMO**—and a predictable temporal rhythm. 

We aren't going to play "their" Valorant. We are going to dismantle their options until they are forced to take 30/70 duels under duress. Here is the tactical blueprint to break G2.

---

### 1. Attack Phase Tactics: Exploiting the Aggression Trap

G2’s defensive identity is built on a 0.995 Aggression Rating. They don’t wait for the hit; they hunt the hit. We will use their own proactivity as a leash to pull them into crossfires.

*   **The "Shadow Default" (0:00 - 0:25):** Since G2 knows teams usually wait 15 seconds to make contact, we will subvert this. We will deploy a "Heavy Fake" on one extremity (e.g., A-Main) using only utility (Sova Recon, Omen Smokes). Meanwhile, four players will hold "Passive Contact" lanes in Mid and the opposite site. G2’s aggressive anchors (JonahP/trent) will see the utility, assume a late-round execute is brewing, and push for a "flank-pick." We catch them dry with a 2-man crossfire.
*   **The "Phantom Slicing" Protocol:** G2 relies on dry aim duels (Vandal-heavy). We will strictly transition to **Phantoms** on our primary executors. We will utilize "Layered Smoking"—dropping a smoke, then dropping a second one three meters ahead of it. This creates a "no-man's land" where G2’s aggressive peekers cannot see our tracers, while we spray through the layers. This nullifies their 50% headshot precision (valyn).
*   **Neutralizing the "Tejo" Variable:** On maps like Lotus or Ascent, where they run the "Tejo" flex, we will play a **4-1 Split**. The "1" (the lurker) must be our most disciplined player, specifically tasked with timing the "Tejo" utility. When G2 uses their niche utility, we do not retreat; we "Burst Through" it. G2's low utility share means once that niche ability is spent, they have nothing left to stop a fast-paced 4-man trade-fest.

### 2. Defense Phase Tactics: Breaking the 15-Second Dead Zone

G2 is most vulnerable in the first 15 seconds of their attack. They are gathering info and saving utility. We will punish their "thrifty" utility usage by being "Utility Profligate."

*   **The "Five-Second Disruptor":** In 30% of rounds, we will execute a "Deep Site Crunch." At the 1:35 mark (5 seconds into the round), we dump a Breach Stun and a Raze Grenade into their common "Info-Gathering" pockets (like Lobby on Ascent or A-Root on Haven). Because G2 has a 0.005 utility share, they won't have the counter-utility (like a Fade Prowler or Kay/O Knife) to stop our push. We kill their "scouts" before they even clear the first corner.
*   **"Front-Site" Commitment (Anti-Post-Plant):** Statistical data shows G2 has a 100% success rate once the spike is down. **The Retake is a Lie.** We will not play for retakes. We will utilize a "3-Man Anchor" system on the site they favor. Use Sage Walls or Cypher Cages to delay the plant until the 0:20 mark. If they cannot plant until late in the round, their methodical "Control/Grind" style collapses into panic. 
*   **The "Utility Starvation" Trap:** We will use Omen or Astra to smoke their entry paths *every single round* at the 1:25 mark. Since they don't use utility to clear smokes, they are forced to "dry-walk" through them. This forces them into the high-variance gunfights they love, but on our terms (we hold the angle, they move into it).

### 3. Key Player Tactics: The "Cage JAWGEMO" Directive

**Target:** JAWGEMO (Primary Entry, 71 volume, 1.2 KD).
**The Goal:** Isolate, Neutralize, and Frustrate. JAWGEMO is the "Spearhead." If the spearhead snaps, the rest of the team (specifically leaf, who plays low-aggression) becomes a group of passive spectators.

*   **Anti-Dive Geometry:** JAWGEMO plays high-mobility entry roles (Jett/Neon). We will place Cypher Tripwires at "Knee-High" or "Head-High" levels—never waist-high. He is conditioned to jump or slide through standard trips. By placing them at non-standard heights, we catch him mid-animation. 
*   **The "Focus-Fire" Priority:** In every site execute, the "Molly" or "Grenade" utility must be reserved specifically for JAWGEMO’s landing spot (e.g., behind the box on A-Site). We do not aim for the team; we aim for the space JAWGEMO occupies.
*   **Psychological Isolation:** We will use a "Double-Peak" specifically on JAWGEMO. If he enters the site, two defenders will swing him simultaneously. We will ignore the second entry (JonahP) to ensure JAWGEMO is dead. Once JAWGEMO is off the board, G2’s "Entry Redundancy" fails because JonahP and trent lose their "Confidence Buffer." 
*   **The "Leaf" Effect:** Statistics show leaf has significantly lower aggression (38 vs 71). Once JAWGEMO is dead, leaf will naturally default to a "Save" or "Passive" posture. By killing JAWGEMO in the first 3 seconds of an entry, we effectively turn the remaining 4 players into "Defensive Attackers" who are too afraid to trade the site.

**Execution Summary:** Break their timing in the first 15 seconds, kill JAWGEMO at the door, and never—under any circumstances—let them plant the spike. Dismantle the engine, and the car won't move. Clear comms. Eyes up. Let's work.
