As a **Valorant Senior Pattern Recognizer**, I have meticulously cross-referenced the provided scouting report for G2 with the fundamental mechanics of tactical play. G2 is a team that relies on mechanical dominance and defensive proactivity, but their statistical profile reveals several "hard-coded" habits that can be exploited by a disciplined opponent.

The following is the comprehensive identification of G2’s vulnerabilities.

---

### I. Temporal Vulnerability: The "15-Second Dead Zone"
G2 employs a "Patient Information-Gathering Default" with a late first contact time of 15.0 seconds.
*   **The Vulnerability:** Their early round is mathematically predictable. For the first 15 seconds of an attacking round, G2 is in "info-mode" rather than "execution-mode."
*   **The Exploit:** 
    *   **Early Round Aggression:** Defenders should push for deep map control within the first 10 seconds. Since G2 minimizes utility (0.005 share), they likely won't have "anti-push" utility (like a Raze grenade or Breach stun) ready to stop a deep flank or a mid-push early.
    *   **The "Sandwich" Trap:** By the time G2 transitions to contact at 15.0s, your team should have already rotated or pushed behind them, boxing them into their default positions before they can group for an execute.

### II. Mechanical Over-Reliance: The "Utility Void"
G2’s Utility Share is nearly non-existent (0.005), opting for "Weapon-Focused Aim Duels."
*   **The Vulnerability:** They play Valorant like a traditional shooter (CS-style) rather than a tactical ability shooter. They lack "Guaranteed Value" (stuns, flashes, suppresses) and rely entirely on winning 50/50 or 60/40 gunfights.
*   **The Exploit:** 
    *   **Utility Dumping:** Counter their raw aim with "Non-Interactive" utility. Do not give them the aim duel they want. Use Astra pulls, Breach stuns, and Fade seizes to lower their movement speed and accuracy. 
    *   **The Phantom Advantage:** Since G2 prioritizes aim duels, they likely favor the Vandal for 1-tap potential. Your team should use Phantoms and heavy smoke utility (Omen/Viper). Spraying through smokes denies them the "visual" they need for their 50% headshot precision (specifically targeting valyn).

### III. Defensive Over-Extension: The "Aggression Trap"
G2 maintains a 0.995 Defensive Aggression rating. They do not play passive sites; they hunt for picks.
*   **The Vulnerability:** They are emotionally and tactically susceptible to "Lurks" and "Fakes." Their high aggression means they are likely to over-rotate or push out of sites to find contact.
*   **The Exploit:** 
    *   **The "Contact Fake":** Show heavy presence (utility and noise) on A, then stop. G2’s aggressive defenders will likely push through the B-side or Mid to find the "missing" attackers, walking directly into your lurker (leaf-style positioning).
    *   **Aggression Punishment:** Set up "crossfire baits." Let one player show themselves in a vulnerable spot; G2’s aggressive posture will compel them to "punish" that player, leading them into a pre-set kill box.

### IV. Entry Redundancy & The "Spearhead" Focus
G2 has an unusual concentration of entry volume. JAWGEMO (71), JonahP (71), and trent (Primary Specialist) all attempt to lead the pack.
*   **The Vulnerability:** Their executes are "Front-Heavy." If the initial entry burst fails, the team has no secondary "Plan B" because their support player (leaf) is significantly less aggressive (38 attempts).
*   **The Exploit (Targeting the Main Fragger - JAWGEMO):**
    *   **Target: JAWGEMO.** As the high-volume entry with a 1.2 KD, he is the engine of their site takes. 
    *   **The Strategy:** Use "Anti-Dive" utility specifically for him. Cypher Tripwires should be placed at non-standard heights to catch a dashing Jett or a sliding Neon (JAWGEMO's likely roles). 
    *   **Isolate leaf:** Since leaf plays a "Low-Aggression Support" role, if you kill JAWGEMO and JonahP early in the execute, leaf is statistically unlikely to provide the aggressive trade-fragging needed to save the round. Focus all defensive utility on the *first three seconds* of their site entry.

### V. Post-Plant Prevention: The "1.0 Success Rate" Factor
G2 has a perfect post-plant coordination record.
*   **The Vulnerability:** They are unbeatable once the spike is down because they shift into a "Control/Grind" style. This means their "Retake Defense" (as attackers) is elite.
*   **The Exploit:** 
    **The "Kill-the-Carrier" Directive:** You cannot afford to play for the retake against G2. You must commit to "Site Hold" or "Front-Site" defense. Use Sage walls, Killjoy lockdowns, or Viper pits to prevent the plant at all costs. If the plant occurs, you must disrupt their "setup" immediately with high-damage utility (Sova shocks/Brimstone ults) before they can settle into their "Control" positions.

### VI. Composition Vulnerabilities (Map Specific)
*   **The "Tejo" Unknown:** G2 runs an unknown agent/variable ("Tejo") on Lotus, Ascent, and the Icebox/Bind flex map. This suggests a niche setup that relies on an "Information Gap." 
*   **Ascent (Comp A vs B):** They swap between Vyse (Sentinel) and Sova (Initiator). 
    *   **Vulnerability:** When they run Vyse (Comp A), they lack the "Wall-Hack" info of Sova. You can play in "Rat Corners" and deep smokes more effectively. When they run Sova (Comp B), they lack the site-holding power of Vyse; this is when you should execute with high speed to overwhelm their thin site anchors.

### Summary Checklist for Exploitation:
1.  **Counter-Push** during the first 10 seconds of their Attack rounds.
2.  **Avoid dry aim duels;** use displacement utility to ruin their mechanical flow.
3.  **Hard-target JAWGEMO** with Cypher/Killjoy setups; he is the highest statistical threat.
4.  **Bait their defensive aggression** with "Fake Executes" to draw them out of position.
5.  **Stop the plant at all costs;** do not allow them to enter their "Elite Post-Plant" state.
