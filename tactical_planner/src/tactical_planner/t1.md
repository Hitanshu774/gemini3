Key Vulnerabilities in NRG's Gameplay:

1. Lack of Consistent Team-Wide Strategies:
   - No identifiable repeatable coordinated patterns or round structures.
   - Vulnerability: Teams can exploit this by being unpredictable and forcing NRG to adapt on the fly.

2. No Consistent Individual Player Tendencies:
   - Absence of detailed behavioral patterns for key players like brawk.
   - Vulnerability: Opponents can't easily predict player movements or utility usage, but this also means NRG players might be less prepared for specific counter-strategies.

3. Aggressive Playstyle:
   - Classified as "Aggressive" with a high Avg. Entry Rate of 72.
   - Vulnerability: Prone to overextension and can be caught off-guard by well-timed utility and defensive setups.

4. Main Fragger (brawk) Exploitation:
   - brawk is the star entry player.
   - Vulnerability: Punish his aggressive entries with utility like flashes, smokes, and crossfires. Focus fire and isolate him from his team.

5. Varied Agent Compositions:
   - Different compositions for each map without specific setup details.
   - Vulnerability: Opponents can prepare counter-agents and strategies for each map, exploiting the lack of consistency.

6. Unknown Player (Tejo):
   - Tejo appears in multiple compositions but with no clear role or tendencies.
   - Vulnerability: Opponents can target Tejo with specific strategies to disrupt NRG's balance.

7. Lack of Detailed Setup Information:
   - No specific positioning or utility deployment details provided.
   - Vulnerability: Opponents can experiment with different strategies to find what works best against NRG's general playstyle.

By focusing on these vulnerabilities, particularly targeting brawk's aggressive play and exploiting the lack of consistent strategies, opponents can gain a significant advantage against NRG.
