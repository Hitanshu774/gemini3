Based on the scouting report of NRG's gameplay vulnerabilities, I'll craft detailed attack and defense strategies to exploit their weaknesses and counter their key player. Here's the comprehensive approach:

Attack Phase Tactics:

1. Aggressive Early Rotations:
   - Exploit NRG's lack of consistent team-wide strategies by implementing unpredictable early rotations.
   - Use agents with strong mobility (e.g., Jett, Raze) to quickly switch sites and catch NRG off-guard.
   - Example: On Bind, send 3 players A site initially, then quickly rotate 2 to B site using teleporters.

2. Utility Denial:
   - Focus on denying NRG's utility usage, particularly targeting brawk's aggressive entries.
   - Use agents with strong area denial abilities (e.g., Killjoy, Cypher) to control key choke points.
   - Example: Place Killjoy's Nanoswarm and Alarmbot at common entry points on Ascent mid to delay NRG's pushes.

3. Split Push Strategies:
   - Implement split push tactics to create confusion and force NRG to defend multiple angles simultaneously.
   - Use agents with strong post-plant abilities (e.g., Viper, Brimstone) to control retake scenarios.
   - Example: On Haven, execute a 3-1-1 split with smokes and flashes to isolate and overwhelm defenders.

4. Information Gathering:
   - Prioritize gathering information on NRG's player positions and utility usage early in the round.
   - Use agents with recon abilities (e.g., Sova, Fade) to gain intel and adjust strategies accordingly.
   - Example: Use Sova's Recon Bolt at the start of each round to reveal NRG's defensive setup.

Defense Phase Tactics:

1. Crossfire Positioning:
   - Set up crossfires to catch NRG players, especially brawk, in unfavorable engagements.
   - Use agents with strong area control abilities (e.g., Sage, Astra) to create safe zones and deny pushes.
   - Example: On Fracture, position two players at each bridge entrance with overlapping fields of fire.

2. Late-Round Rotations:
   - Implement late-round rotations to counter NRG's aggressive playstyle.
   - Use agents with quick mobility (e.g., Neon, Yoru) to rotate efficiently and catch attackers off-guard.
   - Example: On Breeze, hold a passive default for the first 25 seconds, then aggressively rotate based on gathered information.

3. Utility Stacking:
   - Stack utility on common NRG attack routes, particularly focusing on areas where brawk tends to operate.
   - Use agents with multiple smoke abilities (e.g., Omen, Brimstone) to create layered defenses.
   - Example: On Icebox, place multiple smoke lineups at the top of B ramp to delay and confuse NRG's executes.

4. Anti-Execute Setups:
   - Prepare specific anti-execute setups to counter NRG's aggressive pushes.
   - Use agents with strong post-plant denial abilities (e.g., Killjoy, Cypher) to make retakes difficult.
   - Example: On Ascent, place Killjoy's Turret and Nanoswarm at common plant positions on A site to deter executes.

Key Player Tactics (Countering brawk):

1. Information Denial:
   - Focus on denying brawk information about your team's positions and strategies.
   - Use agents with information obfuscation abilities (e.g., Omen, Skye) to create confusion.
   - Example: Use Omen's Paranoia and smokes to blind brawk during executes, making it difficult for him to trade frags.

2. Isolate and Focus Fire:
   - Identify brawk's common entry paths and set up crossfires to isolate him from his team.
   - Use agents with strong single-target abilities (e.g., Reyna, Chamber) to quickly eliminate brawk.
   - Example: On Bind, have a Chamber player hold elbow aggressively while another player covers from showers, creating a crossfire.

3. Utility Exploitation:
   - Exploit brawk's aggressive playstyle by using utility to punish overextension.
   - Use agents with strong area denial abilities (e.g., Viper, Killjoy) to create unfavorable engagements.
   - Example: Place Killjoy's Nanoswarm at common aggressive positions on Ascent mid to catch brawk pushing without support.

4. Mind Games:
   - Implement mind games to disrupt brawk's decision-making and force him into unfavorable situations.
   - Use agents with decoy abilities (e.g., Yoru, Phoenix) to create confusion and bait out brawk's utility.
   - Example: On Haven, use Yoru's Fakeout to create a false sound cue, luring brawk into a crossfire.

5. Post-Plant Denial:
   - Focus on denying brawk's post-plant impact by using agents with strong retake abilities.
   - Use agents with crowd control abilities (e.g., Sage, Skye) to slow down brawk's rotations and create advantageous retake scenarios.
   - Example: On Split, use Sage's Barrier Orb to delay brawk's B main rotate, allowing your team to safely retake A site.

By implementing these tactics, your team can effectively exploit NRG's vulnerabilities, particularly targeting their star player brawk. This approach combines aggressive and defensive strategies to create a well-rounded game plan that can adapt to NRG's unpredictable playstyle while capitalizing on their lack of consistent strategies.
