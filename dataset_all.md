Game Agenda:

Below is an up‑to‑date overview of all current VALORANT agents (through Veto), their roles (class), their abilities (names + what they do), and their typical “job” in a team comp.

Ability details are summarized from Riot’s official kits and long-form guides rather than copied verbatim. [playvalorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/agents/)

***

## 1. How roles work in VALORANT

VALORANT has four agent **classes** (what Riot calls “roles”): Duelist, Initiator, Controller, Sentinel. [ign](https://www.ign.com/wikis/valorant/Concepts:_Roles_in_Valorant)

- **Duelists**  
  Self-sufficient fraggers. Designed to **take first contact**, create space, and secure opening kills. They usually have mobility or self-heal/self-peek tools. If your team is attacking, duelists are expected to be first or second into sites.

- **Initiators**  
  Utility-focused agents that **gather information, clear angles, and disrupt enemy setups**, enabling duelists to enter safely. Flashes, stuns, scans and crowd control are common.

- **Controllers**  
  Specialists at **blocking vision and shaping engagements** with smokes, walls, slows, and decays. They let the team fight fair duels by removing key sightlines and denying space.

- **Sentinels**  
  Defensive experts that **lock down areas, watch flanks, and protect the team** with traps, walls, heals, or utility denial. They are crucial anchors on defense and for flank security on attack.

On top of class, teams usually think in **tactical roles** like:  
- Primary entry (usually a duelist)  
- Secondary entry / trade fragger  
- Info initiator (Sova, Fade, Skye, Gekko, Tejo)  
- Controller / smoker (Brim, Omen, Viper, Astra, Harbor, Clove)  
- Anchor / flank watcher (Sage, Cypher, Killjoy, Deadlock, Vyse, Veto)  

Below, each agent includes: **class, brief playstyle, abilities, and in-game role.**

## 6. Summary of how roles play out in a match

- **On attack:**
  - **Duelists** take first contact, dash/slide in, and secure space.
  - **Initiators** flash, scan, or concuss key angles before the team swings, and often initiate retakes post‑plant.
  - **Controllers** pre‑smoke common angles, deny rotations with walls, and provide lineups for post‑plant denial.
  - **Sentinels** watch flanks during the hit, set up traps on lurk routes, or hold post‑plant with utility (Killjoy, Cypher, Vyse, Veto).

- **On defense:**
  - **Sentinels** and **controllers** usually anchor sites, stall with walls/smokes/nades, and call rotations.
  - **Initiators** help fight for early map control and retake sites with scans and flashes.
  - **Duelists** either contest early space (aggressive holds, pushes) or play as fast rotation / retake specialists.

<!-- ################################################################################################ -->

Maps guide:
As of the current patches, VALORANT has **11 standard (bomb/defuse) maps** that you’ll see in Ranked/Unrated:  
**Bind, Haven, Split, Ascent, Icebox, Breeze, Fracture, Pearl, Lotus, Sunset, Abyss, Corrode**. [dving](https://dving.net/guides/valorant/gaid-po-vsem-kartam)

(There’s also **The Range** plus 5 Team Deathmatch maps like District, Kasbah, etc., but those are separate from the main tactical map pool.) [bo3](https://bo3.gg/valorant/articles/a-summary-of-all-valorant-maps)

Below is a concise but detailed overview of **each standard map**: layout, unique mechanics, and how they tend to play on attack/defense.

***

## 1. Bind – 2 sites, teleporters, no mid

- **Location / structure:** Moroccan-themed map in Rabat, with **two sites (A and B)** and **no true mid lane**; attackers must approach via two main corridors: A Short / A Bath, and B Long / B Hookah. [esportsinsider](https://esportsinsider.com/valorant-maps)
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - **Two one‑way teleporters:**  
    - A Short → B Long  
    - B Long → A Lobby  
  - Teleports are loud and drop you into predictable exit rooms.
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Attacking is about **conditioning and fast rotations**. You threaten A, then instantly TP to B or vice versa, punishing slow rotates.  
  - A executes often use showers (Bath) control + A Short smokes; B hits rely on Hookah and Long control, plus utility to clear close corners.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders can **push for early info** (A Short, B Long) and fall back through teleporter.  
  - Since there’s no mid, defenders mostly worry about **two straight funnels**, making utility (smokes, nades, Sage walls) very strong at chokes.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Controllers:** Viper, Brimstone, Omen to smoke chokes and deny post‑plant.  
  - **Sentinels:** Cypher/Killjoy to hold Hookah/Long or Bath.  
  - **Initiators:** Skye, Sova, Fade to clear close corners and showers.

***

## 2. Haven – 3 sites, heavy rotations

- **Location / structure:** Bhutan monastery setting with **three sites (A, B, C)**, making defenders spread thinner than on any other map. [esportsinsider](https://esportsinsider.com/valorant-maps)
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - First VALORANT map with **3 spike sites**, no special doors/teleports.  
  - Central **Mid / Garage** area connects to both B and C; A has its own approach via A Long / A Short.
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Attacking teams can **fake one site and quickly pivot to another**, especially between B and C via Garage.  
  - Strong macro around **controlling Mid and Garage** to threaten splits and force defenders to guess.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Because of 3 sites, defenders need good **information and quick rotations**.  
  - Usually 1 anchor per outer site (A, C) plus one defender flexing between B/Mid/Garage.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Initiators:** Sova, Fade, Skye – info on wide sites and for retakes.  
  - **Controllers:** Omen, Astra, Clove to cover many angles and support fast rotates.  
  - **Sentinels:** Cypher/Killjoy to hard‑anchor C or A while others flex.

***

## 3. Split – 2 sites, verticality and tight chokes

- **Location / structure:** Tokyo high‑rise city with **two sites** and a strong emphasis on **vertical fights (Ropes, Heaven)**. [thespike](https://www.thespike.gg/valorant/maps)
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - **Ropes/ziplines** between Mid and A Heaven, plus many elevated “Heaven” positions on both sites.  
  - Multiple tight corridors and 90° corners (A Main, B Main, Vents, Mail, Sewer).
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Takes **heavy utility** to break chokes (smokes, flashes, mollies).  
  - Mid control is crucial for splitting into B Heaven or A Heaven and avoiding purely linear attacks from A Main/B Main.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders benefit from **strong angles and crossfires** from Heaven and Ropes.  
  - Good early utility can completely stall pushes in A Main/B Main.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Controllers:** Astra, Omen, Clove for flexible smokes on many vertical angles.  
  - **Initiators:** Breach, Skye, KAY/O to force through tight chokes.  
  - **Duelists:** Raze, Jett, Neon, who exploit vertical jumps and close-range chaos.

***

## 4. Ascent – 2 sites, classic mid map with doors

- **Location / structure:** Floating Venice-style city in Italy with **two sites** and a large, open **Mid courtyard** connecting them. [beebom](https://beebom.com/valorant-ascent-map-guide/)
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - **Mechanical doors** on A Link and B Market that can be shot to break; when closed, they strongly cut rotations. [turbosmurfs](https://turbosmurfs.gg/article/the-7-maps-in-valorant-rotation)
  - Very clear three-lane structure: **A lane, Mid, B lane**.
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Mid control is **the core win condition**: from Mid, attackers can split A (through Tree) or B (through Market).  
  - Executes often involve closing a door to isolate rotations and then playing post‑plant with control of Mid/Top Mid.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders frequently **contest Mid early** (operator on Mid, KAY/O knife, Sova dart, Sage wall).  
  - Strong setups come from playing around A Tree and B Market as rotation hubs.
- **Strong agents:**  
  - **Controllers:** Omen/Brim for simple smoke patterns; Astra for high‑level setups.  
  - **Initiators:** Sova, KAY/O, Fade for Mid and site info.  
  - **Sentinels:** Killjoy for B, Cypher for A – both anchor extremely well.

***

## 5. Icebox – 2 sites, vertical and tight with ziplines

- **Location / structure:** Arctic shipping yard with **two vertically layered sites** and heavy use of containers and ropes. [dving](https://dving.net/guides/valorant/gaid-po-vsem-kartam)
- **Unique mechanics:**  
  - **Ziplines** under B, elevated planting platforms on both sites.  
  - Many vertical fighting positions (A Nest, Rafters, B Yellow, Tube).
- **How it plays (attack):**  
  - Emphasis on fast, explosive takes and **post‑plant lineups** (especially on A default and B default). [boosting-ground](https://boosting-ground.com/Valorant/guides/map-guides/all-maps-overview)
  - Controlling areas like **Kitchen / Tube (Mid)** lets attackers choke rotations and flank defenders.
- **How it plays (defense):**  
  - Defenders use vertical spots (Rafters, Nest, Yellow, Snowman) plus utility delays (Viper walls, Sage walls, Killjoy nades).

Planning guide:

For building a real tactical counterplan off a scouting report, think in terms of:

what you already have (basic stats, comps, map pool) vs.

extra context that turns raw info into anti-strats you can actually call in-game.

Below are the key information blocks that help a lot when designing counterplans, especially once you start playing best‑of‑3s or against the same teams repeatedly.

1. Team macro tendencies (per map)
Beyond “they like Split + Ascent,” you want:

Preferred sides & round-start patterns

Do they heavily favour attack or defence on certain maps?

How do they open rounds: early aggression, default, rush, exec on contact, fake-heavy, slow contact?

Pace of play by situation

Up in the half vs down in the half – do they speed up when behind or become slower?

After timeouts – do they usually come back with a set play or keep doing the same defaults?

This lets you prep specific round types: “First buy round, they always explode B on Sunset if they won pistol → stack utility for that.”

2. Map-specific comfort and playbook depth
From scouting, capture how deep their playbook is on each map, not just win%:

Number of distinct executes per site (on VOD: do they actually have 3–4 different A executes, or just 1 pattern?)

Default structures

Who takes map control where (e.g., initiator+controller for Mid, duelist soloing extremity, sentinel anchoring)?

How many players are used for early control vs holding passive.

Retake patterns

Which utility and ults they typically save for retakes vs defences?

Do they retake aggressively from one side (e.g., always from Heaven) or coordinate 2–3 angles?

The narrower their playbook, the easier it is to pre-stack counters on their favourite hits.

3. Composition and role dependency
Look at how much their game plan depends on specific agents or players:

Agent pool rigidity

Do they always run one comfort comp on each map, or do they flex picks?

If they are hard‑locked to a single controller or sentinel, you can target bans/picks or counter-picks.

Key-enabler roles

One player doing all initiator work, one controller microing all the smokes, one star duelist getting most first kills.

If one player’s performance or agent is removed (tilt, bad day, target pressure), does the team collapse?

Your counterplan can aim to stress those enablers – e.g., isolate and shut down their star Jett or their only Viper player.

4. Individual player profiles and micro tendencies
Your scouting report should include more than K/D and HS%:

First duels / opening stats

Who takes the majority of first duels, where on the map, and with what weapon.

Are they good at converting openers, or dying for free (high first-death rate)?
​

Positional patterns

Common anchor spots (this Sage always plays B on Split; that Cypher always anchors A on Bind).

Habitual off-angles and repeek tendencies (do they always swing again after a first contact, or fall back?).

Clutch & pressure performance

Who is reliable in 1vX; who chokes.

Do they over-aggress when up in numbers (e.g., throwing 5v3s), which you can exploit with discipline.

These help you design micro-calls: “On defense, don’t peek this guy early; make him retake. On attack, isolate the weak anchor in late-round.”

5. Utility usage patterns (timing, positions, lineups)
For anti-stratting, utility patterns are as important as crosshair placement:

Where they place key utility

Sage walls, Cypher/KJ traps, Viper walls, Omen/Astra smokes, common Sova darts, Fade Haunt spots, Raze nades, etc.
​

When they use it

Are they using early‑round defensive utility (stalling rushes) or saving for retake/post‑plant?

On attack, do they dump everything on execute or play slower with re‑hits?

Ult usage habits

Aggressive ults to open rounds (Jett, Raze, Reyna, KAY/O) vs retake/lockdown ults (Killjoy, Viper, Brim, Harbor).

Do they over‑invest ults in already-won rounds or avoid using them when needed?

This tells you when to hit (e.g., re‑hit a site after they used their wall and mollies, or avoid a site when KJ/Viper ult is up).

6. Economy behaviour and risk tolerance
RIot’s own balance articles highlight how much round-type stats reveal about behaviour.
​

For anti-strats you want to know:

Force-buy vs eco philosophy

Do they force second round often; do they light buy to hit specific gun timings (e.g., Guardian + full util)?

Do they run “hero rifle + pistols” or full eco?

Weapon preferences

Op usage patterns (who ops, where, on what rounds).

Phantom vs Vandal vs Bulldog; Sheriff/frenzy on pistols vs Ghost/Classic util.

Risk profile

Are they willing to stack sites on low buys or just play default?

Do they gamble pushes to recover economy (3‑man pushes into an extremity, mid crunches, etc.)?

This helps you call right expectations per round type: play more default and info‑heavy into their eco and op rounds, more fast-paced into full buys if they’re weak vs rush, etc.
​

7. Reaction patterns: how they adapt mid-round
Numbers alone don’t show how they respond when things go wrong:

After losing map control

If you smoke them off Mid or clear their utility, do they fight back with a re‑push or fall to site?

How quickly do they rotate off an empty site once they lose info?

After losing the first pick

Do they turtle and play retake, or counter‑push the opposite side?

Do they over-rotate and leave gaps for lurkers and late hits?

Timeout & adaptation patterns

Do they introduce new plays after timeouts, or just “try harder” at the same thing?

Across a BO3, do they change comps/layouts from map to map or keep repeating comfort.

Your counterplan should include second-layer adaptations for when they start reacting to your first anti-strats.

8. Pistol, bonus and “swing” rounds
Many analysts emphasise focusing on pistols and swing rounds when anti-stratting, because these rounds disproportionately affect halves and matches.
​

For each opponent, track:

Pistol round scripts

Do they have set strats (e.g., A execute every time on Ascent attack pistol) or random pug‑style plays?

Do they favour heavy util comps on pistol (Sage, KJ, Viper walls) or heavy armor/Classic.

Bonus round approach

Are they willing to fight bonus aggressively (e.g., push with Spectres/SMGs) or play retake/exit?

Key conversion rounds

If they win pistol but lose anti‑eco, do they mentally collapse?

Do they over-invest ults on bonus rounds?

Having specific anti‑pistol and anti‑bonus plans (site stack, anti-rush util, pre‑aimed nades) is huge in organised play.

9. Psychological and tempo factors
While harder to “stat,” good scouting notes on mental game give you exploitable edges:

Tilt patterns

Players who start swinging dry when down 4–5 rounds; IGLs who stop calling defaults and just rush.

Teams that crumble in OT or when facing comebacks.

Comfort zones

Do they always call set plays on full comfort (e.g., always do fast B Fracture when eco is stable)?

Are there maps or sides where they visibly slow down and play scared?

Timeout usage

When do they take timeouts: only when losing big, or also to lock in momentum when winning?

After a timeout, do they stick to safer plays or suddenly rush?

You can plan to break their comfort early (e.g., attack their strongest site first, or hard anti their favourite pistol strat) to push them into their “bad” behaviours.

10. Turning all this into a usable anti-strat doc
Once you know what extra info you want, structure your scouting / counterplan like:

Per map, per side

2–3 bullet points: what they like to do most (default style, favourite exec, strongest site).

2–3 bullet points: our counters (how we’ll counter that default, where we’ll fight, what utility we save).

Per player

Signature agents, typical positions, weakness (e.g., bad under pressure, re-peek habit).

Specific cues: “If X is seen on B early on defence, expect A stack or mid push.”

Round-type pages

Pistols: their scripts + our counter.

Bonus/eco: expected behaviours + our safe plays.

Full buy: their best strat + specific anti-strat (utility placements, stack decisions, lurk rules).
