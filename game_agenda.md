Game Agenda:

Below is an up‑to‑date overview of all current VALORANT agents (through Veto), their roles (class), their abilities (names + what they do), and their typical “job” in a team comp.

Ability details are summarized from Riot’s official kits and long-form guides rather than copied verbatim. 

***

## 1. How roles work in VALORANT

VALORANT has four agent **classes** (what Riot calls “roles”): Duelist, Initiator, Controller, Sentinel. 

- **Duelists**  
  Self-sufficient fraggers. Designed to **take first contact**, create space, and secure opening kills. They usually have mobility or self-heal/self-peek tools. If your team is attacking, duelists are expected to be first or second into sites.

- **Initiators**  
  Utility-focused agents that **gather information, clear angles, and disrupt enemy setups**, enabling duelists to enter safely. Flashes, stuns, scans and crowd control are common.

- **Controllers**  
  Specialists at **blocking vision and shaping engagements** with smokes, walls, slows, and decays. They let the team fight fair duels by removing key sightlines and denying space.

- **Sentinels**  
  Defensive experts that **lock down areas, watch flanks, and protect the team** with traps, walls, heals, or utility denial. They are crucial anchors on defense and for flank security on attack.

On top of class, teams usually think in **tactical roles** like:  
- Primary entry (usually a duelist)  
- Secondary entry / trade fragger  
- Info initiator (Sova, Fade, Skye, Gekko, Tejo)  
- Controller / smoker (Brim, Omen, Viper, Astra, Harbor, Clove)  
- Anchor / flank watcher (Sage, Cypher, Killjoy, Deadlock, Vyse, Veto)  

Below, each agent includes: **class, brief playstyle, abilities, and in-game role.**

## 6. Summary of how roles play out in a match

  - **Initiators** flash, scan, or concuss key angles before the team swings, and often initiate retakes post‑plant.
  - **Controllers** pre‑smoke common angles, deny rotations with walls, and provide lineups for post‑plant denial.
  - **Sentinels** watch flanks during the hit, set up traps on lurk routes, or hold post‑plant with utility (Killjoy, Cypher, Vyse, Veto).

- **On defense:**
  - **Sentinels** and **controllers** usually anchor sites, stall with walls/smokes/nades, and call rotations.
  - **Initiators** help fight for early map control and retake sites with scans and flashes.
  - **Duelists** either contest early space (aggressive holds, pushes) or play as fast rotation / retake specialists.
